Research on traffic strategy of intelligent networked vehicles
==================

According to the operation characteristics of networked hybrid vehicles, based on the theories of multi-objective optimization, optimal control, machine learning, random service system and computer simulation, and facing the challenge of cooperative and autonomous transportation autonomy of large-scale intelligent networked vehicles in the road network, the research is carried out successively from the three levels of intersection, road section and road network. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, The intersection conflict types and resolution methods under different scenarios are analyzed, and the vehicle trajectory optimization control model on the road section is established to realize the route planning of networked hybrid vehicles serving heterogeneous decision-making behavior.
