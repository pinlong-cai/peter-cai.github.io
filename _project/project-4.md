Data processing & Algorithm Application
======



结合历史数据分析风机运行状态，用统计分析和机器学习的方法划分风机运行状态，并判别风机故障问题（温度异常），判别成功率80%以上。
Combined with the historical data, the fan operation state is analyzed, the fan operation state is divided by statistical analysis and machine learning methods, and the fan fault problem (abnormal temperature) is identified, and the success rate is more than 80%.
